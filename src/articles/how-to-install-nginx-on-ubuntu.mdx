## Introduction

NGINX is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverses proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. NGINX is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption. This article will show you how to install Nginx on Ubuntu and use it as aÂ  web server or reverse proxy.

## Install Nginx

```bash
ssh user@hostname
```

- The&nbsp;`user`&nbsp;is the username of your server. (e.g.&nbsp;`root`)
- The&nbsp;`hostname`&nbsp;is your server's public IP address. (e.g.&nbsp;`123.45.67.890`)

After you press enter, a prompt will pop up asking for your password. When typing your password, you will not see anything in your terminal.

We only want to allow HTTP traffic on port 80. Run the following command:

```shell
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
```

## NGINX Configuration

Now that you have learned how to install and set up Nginx. It's time to configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to point to your API.

1. Remove the default Nginx config

```shell
sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Restart Nginx by running the following command

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
```

2. Create index.html file

```shell
mkdir -p /var/www/test.com/html
sudo nano /var/www/test.com/html/index.html

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello world!!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world!!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/test.com
```

Add the following config below:

```shell
server {

        listen 80;
        root /var/www/test.com/html;
        index index.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

5. Enable the server by symlinking to the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled directory

```shell
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/test.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Change `test.com` with your config name.
